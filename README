Numerically Solving Planar DC Problems
using Resistor Meshes, Matrix Math and Python
---------------------------------------------

Learn how to solve planar dc problems using numerical methods. Including an
example problem that would be very hard to solve analytically but can be solved
easily using a relatively small python program. The results are verified with a
simple experiment.  This video also includes a very brief introduction to the
bits and pieces of linear algebra that are needed for solving this kind of
problems.
